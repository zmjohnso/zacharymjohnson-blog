## Career
I launched my professional career in February, 2021 at the software consultancy [Atomic Object](https://www.atomicobject.com/team/zachary-johnson). While at Atomic I have worked on multiple projects with a variety of tech stacks, including React/Node and Angular/.NET Core projects. In addition to this site, I write for the Atomic Object blog, known as [Spin](https://spin.atomicobject.com/author/zach-johnson/).
## Interests
My technical interests include Bitcoin, competitive programming, viewing traditional finance through a Bitcoin-native lense, and increasing my financial literacy. When away from the computer I enjoy running and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
